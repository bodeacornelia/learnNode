## MY FIRST I/O! (Exercise 3 of 13)  

  Write a program that uses a single synchronous filesystem operation to
  read a file and print the number of newlines (\n) it contains to the
  console (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.

  The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first
  command-line argument (i.e., process.argv[2]). You do not need to make
  your own test file.


   ## MY FIRST ASYNC I/O! (Exercise 4 of 13)

  Write a program that uses a single asynchronous filesystem operation to
  read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console
  (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.

  The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first
  command-line argument.
